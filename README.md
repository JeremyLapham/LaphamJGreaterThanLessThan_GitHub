This program will ask the user for two numbers and it will compare them
Peer Review: Richard Johnson - This program seems to work the way it should. It accurately compares whichever 
two numbers are typed into the console, and it will ask the user if they want to play again. The program verifies 
if you're typing a number or not, and will not compare the inputs if you type letters instead of numbers. Though, 
if the user types a very long number, it will not be taken as a number input, though that's not really that big 
of an issue, as not many people will be comparing super long numbers like that. Otherwise, it is coded very well.
